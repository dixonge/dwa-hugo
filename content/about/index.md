Philip Dixon was born in San Angelo, Texas in 1967 and spent his early years growing up in Big Lake. He spent a lot of time on the Rocker B and Tucker ranches, which instilled in him a passion for the outdoors and a penchant for quail, turkey, and deer hunting before moving to Fort Worth with his family in 1973. He has lived in Texas his whole life. For many years he has enjoyed hunting, fishing and playing on the Circle S Ranch just northwest of Strawn. Philip is an avid hunter, outdoorsman and wildlife photographer and has spent many years involved in game management. He is a member of Caddo Wildlife Management Association, one of the oldest active game management associations in Texas, and for the past several years has helped game and food plot management on his father-in-law’s ranch north of Ranger.

Philip took his first art lesson at Heritage Hut in River Oaks at the age of 10, studying under Nancy and Terrie Brown, who are well known in the artist community and have published several art books. He was also lucky enough as a young teenager to take a workshop with the famous American painter Joseph Dawley. Philip still visits the Heritage Hut and has a lifelong relationship with Nancy and Terri, and he says, “The day you stop learning is the day you quit.”
